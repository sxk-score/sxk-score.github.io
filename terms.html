				<p>
					Please read this agreement carefully. By downloading or using all or any part of the sheet music on this site, you accept all of the terms within this agreement.

                    <p>
                        Unlike other license agreements that deprive you of your freedom of use, this agreement gives you full freedom of community use. All sheet music on this site is copyrighted by Scilxurkel (“Sxk”).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        1. License <br> 
                        SxkL grants you a non-exclusive, transferable right to use the sheet music on this website on multiple computers simultaneously.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        2. Use of Sheet Music <br>
                        2.1 You may modify, transmit, copy or change the sheet music and its associated files on this website. If you wish to distribute, transfer or publish these files, you must cite the original source (the MuseScore link of the sheet music) and distribute, transfer or publish them on a non-commercial and non-profit basis. When merely redistributing the files from this website, you must cite the original source and publish them under this agreement; when modifying, adapting, and publishing under your new work's name, you may use other agreements, but you must not impose more restrictive terms than the original agreement (more permissive terms may include any one or more of the following: no attribution required, allowing commercial use, or no requirement for the same license to be applied). For example, the CC BY-NC 4.0 license is an acceptable agreement. <br>
                        2.2 In commercial and profit-making situations, you must obtain authorization before playing, sharing, reprinting or publishing the sheet music.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        - What is "commercial and profit-making"? <br>
                        -- Directly profiting from the sheet music, such as commercial performances, or re-arrangements and re-publications that can be directly perceived as profitable (able to directly earn money), such as providing "exclusive arranged sheet music" as a member benefit on the Patreon platform, or selling sheet music based on the sheet music from this website on the MyMusicSheet platform, as well as performances in public venues with profit as the main purpose (such as commercial concerts, paid restaurant/bar performances, and corporate business activities) are considered "commercial and profit-making" activities. <br>
                        -- Activities such as the creative incentive programs on video platforms like YouTube and Bilibili, non-profit performances organized by non-profit organizations, performances by schools or educational institutions for learning purposes (regardless of whether the venue is paid or whether you receive compensation), and personal performances on open platforms (such as streets, free live streams) (even if you receive tips) are not considered "commercial and profit-making" activities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        - How is "re-arrangement" defined? <br>
                        -- If your adapted work is based on the original sheet music's original expression (such as the main melody, distinctive harmony, unique arrangement structure), and is used for commercial purposes (as defined in 2.2), you need to obtain authorization. <br>
                        -- If your work only slightly references the original sheet music (such as fragment sampling, inspirational reference), or if the adapted work is used for non-commercial purposes, you do not need authorization, but you must still use it according to the terms in section 2.1.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        3. Termination <br>
                        You can terminate this agreement at any time by destroying the sheet music files and their accompanying documents. Re-downloading the sheet music files is considered as re-complying with this agreement. If you violate any terms of this agreement, you may face legal risks. If your breach constitutes a material infringement of SxkL's intellectual property rights (including but not limited to unauthorized commercial use, malicious removal of copyright information), SxkL has the right to claim civil liability according to law. However, SxkL will first send you an infringement notice. If you stop the breach and take remedial measures (such as adding attribution or taking down the infringing content) within 10 days of receiving the notice, SxkL promises to waive the liability for compensation and only retains the right to demand the cessation of infringement. This clause does not affect SxkL's right to pursue other legal responsibilities for malicious infringement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        4. Warranty <br>
                        4.1 SxkL guarantees that the website can freely download the sheet music under normal circumstances (excluding updates and replacements of the sheet music files), and that normal use will not encounter any issues or defects caused by the sheet music files. The sheet music may be updated irregularly, and when updates occur, you can re-download the updated sheet music. <br>
                        4.2 SxkL does not guarantee the continuous operation or error-free operation of files unrelated to this sheet music or software used to open this sheet music (such as MuseScore and Dorico), nor does it guarantee the continuous operation or error-free operation of sheet music hosted on other third-party websites outside of this website (such as Musescore.com and Mymusicsheet).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        5. Forks and Mirrors <br>
                        5.1 Non-commercial forks are allowed: You may create a copy (fork) or mirror site of this website, but only for non-commercial purposes. <br>
                        5.2 Mandatory inheritance of the agreement: <br>
                            (a) All sheet music and derivative content in the fork/mirror site must continue to comply with all terms of this agreement (including attribution, non-commercial use, and permissive relicensing). <br>
                            (b) The complete text of this agreement must be provided with a link in a prominent position on the site's homepage. <br>
                        5.3 Conditions for enabling mirror sites: Mirror sites can only be publicly available when the main site (sxk-score.top and sxk-score.github.io) is continuously inaccessible for at least 72 hours. <br>
                        5.4 Disclaimer obligation: Fork/mirror sites must clearly state at the bottom of all pages: "This site is a non-official fork/mirror of Scilxurkel (SxkL), and the rules for using sheet music are based on section 2 of this agreement." <br>
                        5.5 Prohibition of misleading associations: You must not use the official name or logo of SxkL or claim to have authorization or a partnership with SxkL.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        6. Limitation of liability <br>
                        6.1 User's own fault: SxkL is not liable for any damages resulting from your misuse, abuse of the sheet music, or violation of this agreement (including data loss, business losses, etc.). <br>
                        6.2 Inherent risks of sheet music: SxkL is not liable for losses caused by the subjectivity of artistic creation (such as failure to meet expected performance outcomes or disputes). <br>
                        6.3 Liability cap: <br>
                        If the technical defects in the sheet music files provided by SxkL (referring to files downloaded from sxk-score.top or sxk-score.github.io that contain reproducible formatting errors, data corruption, or symbol encoding errors, and these defects existed at the time of file release) cause you to suffer verifiable direct losses, SxkL's maximum liability for compensation is $10 per sheet music file, with a total liability not exceeding $50 (although all sheet music on this website is freely provided as source files). <br>
                        6.4 Third-party content: <br>
                            (a) The third-party websites mentioned on this site are for reference only, and SxkL does not control their content. <br>
                            (b) If SxkL recommends a third-party link that provides infringing sheet music despite knowing it, or fails to remove the third-party link after receiving an infringement notice, SxkL will bear liability for contributory infringement. <br>
                        6.5 Non-exempt circumstances: This clause does not exclude SxkL's liability for intentional infringement, gross negligence, or personal injury.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That’s all the terms.
