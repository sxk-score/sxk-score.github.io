				<h1>Rapid As Wildfires</h1>
				<p>
					"Rapid as Wildfires" is a track composed by Yu-Peng Chen, included in the album <i>Genshin Impact - Jade Moon Upon a Sea of Clouds.</i> As a battle theme for Liyue, it not only incorporates many traditional Chinese musical elements but also creates a sense of combat, urgency, and grandeur in the composition.

					<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
					<p>
						Got a fever, 39 degrees Celsius, so here’s to making a musical score to reduce it. <br>
						This score was made in Dorico 5 and a MusicXML file was exported and imported into MuseScore, for compatibility reasons this score uses MuseScore 3 to support the MuseScore mobile app and those still using MuseScore 3. <br>
						As for why I didn’t use the latest MuseScore 4.2, the reason is that the bugs I’ve been feeding back in GitHub for a full year now have not been resolved, so I’ve temporarily switched to Dorico for better scoremaking and layout support, and this is the first score I’ve made with Dorico. <br>
						The production process was very hard, from the project to the full production of the score took three years (actually two and a half years of procrastination, only half a year was spent on the production of this score), the handwritten score was revised three times, but thanks to the efficient performance of Dorico and MuseScore, the conversion from handwritten sheet music to electronic sheet music only took three days. <br>
						<br>
						Note: You need at least MuseScore 3.6 to open the MSCZ file. If you are using older versions of MuseScore or other notation software, MusicXML will be more suitable. <br>
						And you need Dorico 5 to open dorico file.
