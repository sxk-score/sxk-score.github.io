            Introduction:<br>
            Another Touhou Song!
            Cute three fairies!
            But the vocals is so hard to arrange, so I've just arrange the tone of voice, haha.

            Additional: I have two stupid roommates in the dormitory, one every day and their friends open voice chat game, the sound is incredibly loud, one every day to bring his girlfriend back to play, these two screwed up until 1-2 am, so I can not sleep well every night! I've tried to notice them, but they don't give a sh*t, so I can only hang them out here in public, and I just want to say f*ck you two guys to them!

            Note:<br>
            Note: You need at least MuseScore 3.6 to open the MSCZ file. If you are using older versions of MuseScore or other notation software, MusicXML will be more suitable.<br>
            And you need Dorico 5.1 to open dorico file.
            Warn that you may lose some details and layout may be different if you use MuseScore 4.<br>
