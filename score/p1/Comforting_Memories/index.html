            Introduction:<br>
            This is one of my favourite pieces of music in Minecraft 1.18.<br>
            I made a full score and it has maybe up to 85 per cent restoration.<br>
            Hope you will like.<br>
            (PS: You will have a better playback effect if you use Dorico to open the dorico file in the archive.)

            Note:<br>
            You need MuseScore 4.3 to open the MSCZ file. If you are using MuseScore 3.6 or other notation software, MusicXML will be more suitable.<br>
            And you need Dorico 5 to open dorico file.
