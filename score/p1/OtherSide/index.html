            Introduction:<br>
            My favorite music in Minecraft 1.18 OST!<br>
            I made a full score and it has maybe up to 85 per cent restoration.<br>
            Hope you will like.<br>
            (PS: You will have a better playback effect if you use Dorico to open the dorico file in the archive.)

            Note:<br>
            Note: You need at least MuseScore 3.6 to open the MSCZ file. If you are using older versions of MuseScore or other notation software, MusicXML will be more suitable.<br>
            And you need Dorico 5.1 to open dorico file.
            Warn that you may lose some details and layout may be different if you use MuseScore 4.<br>
