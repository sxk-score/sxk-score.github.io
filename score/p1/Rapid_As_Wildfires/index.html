          Got a fever, 39 degrees Celsius, so here's to making a musical score to reduce it.<br>
          This score was made in Dorico 5 and a MusicXML file was exported and imported into MuseScore, for compatibility reasons this score uses MuseScore 3 to support the MuseScore mobile app and those still using MuseScore 3.<br>
          As for why I didn't use the latest MuseScore 4.2, the reason is that the bugs I've been feeding back in GitHub for a full year now have not been resolved, so I've temporarily switched to Dorico for better scoremaking and layout support, and this is the first score I've made with Dorico.<br>
          The production process was very hard, from the project to the full production of the score took three years (actually two and a half years of procrastination, only half a year was spent on the production of this score), the handwritten score was revised three times, but thanks to the efficient performance of Dorico and MuseScore, the conversion from handwritten sheet music to electronic sheet music only took three days.<br>
