				<h1>Walking the Streets of a Former Hell</h1>
				<p>
                    "Walking the Streets of a Former Hell" is the Stage 3 theme from the 11th Touhou Project work, "Touhou Chireiden ~ Subterranean Animism." Due to its use of the Chinese pentatonic scale and an arrangement that evokes a traditional New Year atmosphere, it is highly beloved by Chinese players, who often compare it to "Chinese Sausage."  <br>

					<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
					<p>
                        Happy New Year! <br>
                        This piece is very suitable for the boisterous New Year, so I made it. <br>
                        After all, ZUN described it as "a song composed with the image of the peaceful and boisterous streets of Edo." <br>
                        However, it seems to have clashed with "Chinese Sausage," and now it has become "Chinese Sausage of Former Hell" lol. <br>
                        But if you want to play it... then try to simplify the left-hand part as much as possible. <br>
						<br>
                        Note: You need at least MuseScore 4.7 to open MSCZ files. If you use an older version of MuseScore or other notation software, then MusicXML is more suitable for you. <br>
                        Since many people might not have MuseScore 4.7 yet, here is the Beta version download link: 
                        <a href="https://musescore.org/zh-hans/node/389515">Download MuseScore 4.7 Beta</a> <br>

                        Alternatively, you can download it using the GitHub Actions interface, but this requires a GitHub account. <br>
                        The reason for using MuseScore 4.7 is because it features ASIO driver support. <br>
